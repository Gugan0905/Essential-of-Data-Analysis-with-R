# Essentials-of-Data-Analysis-with-R
This repository contains all the R files I used in my Essentials of Data Analytics course to learn and understand data science with R.
<Before using any code files, please make sure to update the setwd() function with your current working directory.

The examples files and respective datasets are as follows. Most folder/file names are self-explanatory and have the code and dataset files inside them:
1. _'./Simple and Multiple Linear Regression on Credit Worthiness'_
2. _'./Forecasting Petrol price with Auto Correlation and ARIMA'_
3. _'./
